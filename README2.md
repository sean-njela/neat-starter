## 📋 Prerequisites

> This project uses [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/) to manage the development environment. Devbox provides a consistent, isolated environment with all the necessary CLI tools pre-installed.

0. **Install Docker**

   - Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

> The rest of the tools are already installed in the devbox environment

1. **Install Devbox**

   - Follow the [installation instructions](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/docs/installing_devbox/) for your operating system.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Start the Devbox Environment and poetry environment**

   ```bash
   devbox shell # Start the devbox environment (this will also start the poetry environment)
   poetry install # Install dependencies
   poetry env activate # use the output to activate the poetry environment ( ONLY IF DEVBOX DOES NOT ACTIVATE THE ENVIRONMENT)
   ```
> Note - The first time you run `devbox shell`, it will take a few minutes to install the necessary tools. But after that it will be much faster.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# this one command will run all commands necessary to setup the environment. yes, really.
task dev
```

## ✅ Tasks (Automation)

> This project is designed for a simple, one-command setup. All necessary actions are orchestrated through `Taskfile.yaml`.

```bash
task setup # setup the environment
task dev # automated local provisioning
task cleanup-dev # cleanup the dev environment
```

### Git Workflow with Git Flow

The `Taskfile.gitflow.yaml` provides a structured Git workflow using Git Flow. This helps in managing features, releases, and hotfixes in a standardized way. To run these tasks just its the same as running any other task. Using gitflow is optional.

```bash
task init                 # Initialize Git Flow with 'main', gh-pages and 'develop'
task sync                 # Sync current branch with latest 'develop' and handle main updates
task release:finish       # Finishes and publishes a release (merges, tags, pushes). e.g task release:finish version="1.2.0"
```

To see all tasks:

```bash
task --list-all
```

If you do not want the gitflow tasks, you can remove the `Taskfile.gitflow.yaml` file and unlink it from the `Taskfile.yaml` file (remove the `includes` section). If you cannot find the section use CTRL + F to search for Taskfile.yaml.
