title: Zero Trust Architecture in Microservices
date: 2025-09-17T22:32:42.052Z
description: This project implements a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) within a
  microservices ecosystem to enhance security and trust boundaries across
  distributed systems. Built with Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, and Terraform, it
  automates the deployment and scaling of secure service meshes and
  infrastructure. The project showcases infrastructure-as-code practices, secure
  service-to-service communication, and policy enforcement using modern DevOps
  tooling. Itâ€™s a practical demonstration of ZTA concepts applied in real-world
  microservices environments, ideal for high-assurance system design.
